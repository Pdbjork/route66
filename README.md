This repository contains a simple SwiftUI application for iOS that displays the historic Route 66 with a sample list of points of interest. The app calculates directions between Chicago and Santa Monica using `MapKit` and marks notable locations along the route.

## Features

- Shows sample points of interest along the road
- Allows users to view the route from Chicago, IL to Santa Monica, CA

## Building
